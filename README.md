Calculator for Speed Demerit Points

CalculateDemeritPoints(speed), a JavaScript program, assists in calculating the demerit points a driver accrues in relation to their speed limit. It also determines whether the license suspension is appropriate.
How to Apply

    Use a JavaScript environment to run the program, such as Node.js or a browser console.
    Use the required speed as an input when calling the function calculateDemeritPoints(speed).
    The software will compute demerit points based on the comparison of the speed and the speed restriction.
    It will indicate whether the driver's license should be suspended and print the total number of demerit points, if appropriate.
Speed Requirements

    In the event that the speed falls below the speed restriction of 70, the program outputs "Ok."
    When a user exceeds the speed limit, the application determines demerit points using a specified rate.
    If the demerit points exceed the maximum allowed (12), the program prints "License suspended."
